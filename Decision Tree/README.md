Decision Tree Code Guide

Datasets: The datasets had one row aded to the top that held the names of the attribute, therefore the files are slightly different than the ones that were 
posted to Canvas, but the dataset itself is exactly the same. For convenience, please use the the files in the repository.

ID3.py: This file sets up and calls the functions to generate the trees as well as all of the code to test the various depths and gains. It also includes the
code for the two different methods of dealing with 'unknown' (it adjusts the dataframe before passing it to the ID3 algorithm).

Functions.py: This file contains all of the functions necessary to perform the ID3 algorithm.
